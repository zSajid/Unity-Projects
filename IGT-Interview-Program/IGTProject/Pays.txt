AB (Any Bar) == 1B or 2B or 3B.  (e.g. 2B 3B 1B == AB AB AB)

Only pay the highest paying combination.

For instance, your reels stop on 1B 1B 1B.  
That matches the pay combos 1B 1B 1B and AB AB AB.  
Only pay 1B 1B 1B, since it pays more.

If your reels stop on anything not listed above, 
it pays nothing for that spin.
